## Student Performance Indicator

### 1) Problem Statement

This project aims to develop a predictive model for evaluating student performance indicators. The goal is to understand how students' test scores are influenced by various factors such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parental Level of Education, Lunch, and Test Preparation Course.

### 2) Data Collection

- **Dataset Source:** [Students Performance in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977)
- **Dataset Information:**
  - 8 columns and 1000 rows.

### 3) Data Checks

Performing essential checks on the dataset:
1. **Check Missing Values:** No missing values in the dataset.
2. **Check Duplicates:** No duplicate values.
3. **Check Data Types:** Ensuring correct data types.
4. **Check Unique Values:** Examining the number of unique values in each column.
5. **Check Statistics:** Analyzing basic statistics of the dataset.

### 4) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explore the data visually to gain insights:
1. **Visualizing Average Scores:** Histograms and KDEs for average and total scores.
2. **Maximum Score Analysis:** Violin plots for math, reading, and writing scores.
3. **Multivariate Analysis:** Pie plots for Gender, Race/Ethnicity, Lunch, Test Preparation Course, and Parental Education.

### 5) Conclusions

- Student performance is related to lunch, race, and parental level of education.
- Females tend to lead in pass percentage and are top-scorers.
- Test preparation course completion is beneficial but not significantly related to performance.
